This tutorial combines the theory and practical application of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for Text-to-Speech (TTS). It illustrates how DNNs are rapidly advancing the performance of all areas of TTS, including waveform generation and text processing, using a variety of model architectures. We link the theory to implementation with the Open Source [Merlin toolkit](https://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/merlin/).

Deep learning has been successfully applied to solve various complex problems. However, deep learning algorithms have also been employed to create deepfakes (e.g. fake audios, images and videos) for misleading information. Deepfakes are increasingly detrimental to privacy, society security and even democracy. This talk first introduces the state-of-the-art voice generation algorithms which can be leveraged to manipulate or create audio audio content. Following by an overview of the audio deepfake detection efforts done by the research community through the ASVspoof challenges, the talk concludes with a discussion of the challenges in audio deepfake detection.
